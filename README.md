This is a website where users can share a fact they learned with the world and vote on all the other facts.

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript React, and Node.js. I also used Supabase as the database.

It is deployed with GitHub pages: https://catherine-ge.github.io/Fun-Facts/

Here is a demo video of the website.
